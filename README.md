# 🎓 Lumina AI: Text-First Voice Assistant

> **Elevate your reading with high-fidelity, on-demand AI explanations.**

Lumina is a premium Chrome extension that transforms static web content into a dynamic audio learning experience. Unlike traditional "read-aloud" tools, Lumina provides deep synthesis and multi-turn dialogue, focusing on a **Text-First, On-Demand** architecture that prioritizes immediate feedback and user agency.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights (The Resume Bits)
*   **Latency Masking Architecture**: Implements a two-stage sequential audio cue system ("Sure thing..." → "Alright...") to eliminate perceived synthesis gaps, creating a high-end, responsive feel.
*   **Contextual Multi-Turn Persistence**: Developed a history restoration system that persists entire dialogue threads and audio associations across sessions using `chrome.storage`.
*   **On-Demand TTS Streaming**: Engineered a lazy-loading audio system that only generates speech upon explicit user request, significantly reducing server overhead.
*   **Custom UI Framework**: Built a fully resizable, draggable, glassmorphic overlay using Vanilla JS and CSS Flexbox for zero-dependency performance.
*   **Smart Cache Logic**: Implemented MD5-based server-side caching to provide instant (zero-cue) playback for previously generated content.

## ✨ Features
*   **⚡ Instant Response**: Get the explanation as text immediately; listen whenever you're ready.
*   **🗣️ Curated Voices**: Powered by `Kyutai Pocket-TTS` with high-quality models (Alba, Marius, Jean).
*   **🧠 Intelligent Follow-ups**: Ask additional questions without stopping current audio playback.
*   **📐 Flexible Workspace**: Resize and move the query widget and player to fit your browsing style.
*   **interactive Audio**: Full progress-bar control with click-to-seek functionality.
